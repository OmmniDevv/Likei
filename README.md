# <h1 align="center"><strong><em>Julex - A Special Project</em></strong></h1>

**Julex** is a photo gallery website I made using React and Vite as a gift for my girlfriend to celebrate our 1-year anniversary. It’s filled with love and memories, designed to showcase our favorite moments in a simple and beautiful way.

**What I learned while making Julex:**

    • JavaScript: Enhanced my ability to create dynamic, interactive features.
    • CSS & Layout Design: Improved my ability to style complex layouts, focusing on consistency, responsiveness, and user-friendly aesthetics.
    • Project Organization: Learned to structure and manage projects effectively using Vite for better productivity.
    • Animations and Transitions: Learned how to use CSS animations and React libraries to add subtle transitions for a polished user experience.

Julex is a project that means a lot to me and shows both my love and my progress as a developer. ❤️
