<h1 align="center"><strong><em>Julex - A Special Project</em></strong></h1>

**Julex** is a photo gallery website I made using React and Vite as a gift for my girlfriend to celebrate our 1-year anniversary. It’s filled with love and memories, designed to showcase our favorite moments in a simple and beautiful way.

**What I learned while making Julex:**

    • Got better at using JavaScript to create interactive features.
    • Improved my CSS skills for styling and making the site look nice.
    • Learned how to build and organize components in React.
    • Used Vite to make the project run faster and smoother.

Julex is a project that means a lot to me and shows both my love and my progress as a developer. ❤️
