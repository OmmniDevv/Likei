<h1 align="center"><strong>Julex - A Special Project</strong></h1>

Julex is a photo gallery website I made using React and Vite as a gift for my girlfriend to celebrate our 1-year anniversary. It’s filled with love and memories, designed to showcase our favorite moments in a simple and beautiful way.

**What I Learned While Making Julex**

  - Got better at using JavaScript to create interactive features.
  - Improved my CSS skills for styling and making the site look nice.
  - Learned how to build and organize components in React.
  - Used Vite to make the project run faster and smoother.

Julex is a project that means a lot to me and shows both my love and my progress as a developer. ❤️
